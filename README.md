# Range-vs-Habitat
Location for analysis comparing GAP species' range and habitat areas across CONUS

This repository contains Python code to generate a scatter plot comparing GAP species' range and habitat areal extents. Such a comparison can then be used for an analysis of species whose habitat is potentially restricted within their range.
