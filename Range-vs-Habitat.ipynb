    "# Comparing Areal Extent of GAP Species' Range and Habitat Maps\n",
    "<br/>\n",

    "## Purpose <a name=\"purpose\"></a>\n",
    "A number of authors have explored methods for delineating the geography of species’ distributions (e.g. Graham and Hijmans 2006, Jetz et al. 2008, Gaston and Fuller 2009, Beresford et al. 2011). Researchers commonly distinguish between extent of occurrence (EOO), and extent of suitable habitat (ESH) to describe range-based and habitat-based geographic representation respectively. Techniques for generating EOO and ESH vary widely which can have significant effects on estimations such as population size (Freckleton et al. 2006), protection status, and richness measurements (Rondinini et al. 2011, McKerrow et al. 2018). Typically, ESH is viewed as a subset of EOO, that is, species habitat is a combination of physiographic, biological, and climatological landscape attributes within a broad extent where a given species is known to occur. Comparing range and habitat extent (EOO and ESH) across numerous taxa can reveal a number of important conservation concern attributes including habitat specialization, endemism, and extinction risk (Jetz et al. 2008, Harris and Pimm 2008, Gaston and Fuller 2009).\n",
    "\n",
    "The U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Project (GAP) created range and habitat maps for 1590 terrestrial vertebrates that are known to occur within the conterminous United States (CONUS) including 219 sub-species (McKerrow et al. 2018). GAP species maps individually or in any variety of species groupings have a number of uses to aid scientists, managers and policy makers in biodiversity research and planning. Comparing the extent of occurrence and habitat for amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles throughout CONUS can provide quantifiable insights into attributes that may highlight conservation concerns previously overlooked in assessments of species’ geographies.\n",

    "## Inputs <a name=\"inputs\"></a>\n",
    "The code in this notebook examines the relationship between species' range and habitat maps developed by the U.S. Geological Survey Gap Analysis Project (McKerrow et al. 2018). All 1719 vertebrate species taxa (species and sub-species) in four groups (amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles) considered present in the conterminous US at some time in their life history are included in the analyses. The input processing species list could be altered to conduct a species subset analysis.\n",

    "It utilizes individual species range and habitat data available on the [USGS ScienceBase data catalog](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/) as attached files in each species' child item.
